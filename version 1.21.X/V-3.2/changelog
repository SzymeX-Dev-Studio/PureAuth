🎨 Visual & Logging Upgrades (Discord)
Rich Embeds: Discord notifications are no longer plain text. They now use Professional Embeds with color coding:
🟢 Green: Server Start, Successful Logins, Unlocks.
🟠 Orange: Failed Login Attempts, Password Changes.
🔴 Red: Server Stop, Account Lockouts, Unregistering users.
🔵 Blue: Premium Status Changes.
Full Audit Logging: Every administrative action is now logged to Discord (Force Login, Set Password, Unregister, etc.), not just security breaches.
💎 Premium Auto-Login (Refined)
ProtocolLib Removed: The plugin no longer requires ProtocolLib to function. It now uses a stable IP-Trust System.
Logic Change:
Players use /premium to verify their account with Mojang API.
The plugin saves their current IP address.
Auto-Login only occurs if the player joins from that exact trusted IP.
If the IP changes, the plugin falls back to requesting a password for security.
🛡️ Administrative Improvements
Smart Command Feedback: Admin commands (like /pureauth setpassword) now display correct usage examples if arguments are missing, rather than failing silently.
Unknown Command Handling: Typing an invalid subcommand now returns a helpful error message instead of doing nothing.
