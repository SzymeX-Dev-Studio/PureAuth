1. Installation
Download PureAuth.jar and the ProtocolLib plugin (this is mandatory for identity verification features).

Upload both files to the /plugins folder on your server.

Restart the server (using /reload is not recommended for the initial setup).

2. Initial Configuration
Navigate to the /plugins/PureAuth folder and open config.yml.

Database: The default is SQLITE. For larger networks, change this to MYSQL and fill in your credentials.

Discord: To enable alerts, set enabled: true and paste your link into webhook_url.

Auto-Login: Under the premium_login section, ensure enabled: true is set.

3. Activation
After saving the file, type /pureauth reload ingame or in the console.

Done! Your server is now secured by PureAuth.
