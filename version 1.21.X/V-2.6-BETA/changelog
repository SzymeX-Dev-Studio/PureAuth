This is a MAJOR update. Please read carefully.
⚠️ IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
ProtocolLib is now REQUIRED for this version to function correctly.
You must delete your old config.yml to generate the new one.
💎 Premium Auto-Login (FastLogin)
Added automatic login for Premium Minecraft users.
UUID Protection: Uses packet injection to force the server to use Offline UUIDs even for Premium players. This prevents inventory/data loss when switching between Cracked and Premium modes.
IP Security: Auto-login requires the player to join from the same IP address as their last successful login (configurable).
New Commands:
/premium: Enables auto-login for your account (verifies with Mojang API).
/cracked: Disables auto-login and requires password entry.
🔒 Brute-Force Protection (Account Locking)
If a player is kicked 3 times (default) for max password attempts, their account is LOCKED.
Locked players cannot move, chat, or execute commands upon joining.
Admins must use /pureauth unlock <player> to restore access.
🔔 Discord Webhook Integration
Get real-time alerts on your Discord server for:
Failed login attempts.
Account lockouts.
Admin actions (Force Login, Unregister, Password Change).
🛠️ Admin Tools & Fixes
New Command: /pureauth register <player> <password> (Register players manually).
New Command: /pureauth unlock <player> (Unlocks a blocked account).
Fixed Command: /pureauth setpassword now correctly identifies players by UUID, fixing issues where the password wouldn't update in-game.
Better Stats: /pureauth stats now displays detailed security and premium settings.
